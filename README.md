## Problem 1

Write a JavaScript program that reads a five letter word from the user and produces all possible three letter (combination/words) that can be derived from the letters of the five letter word. Output the results to an HTML5 text area.

For example if the users enters sharp, it should produce three letter words including: sha sah sar sap spa has hap ash asp aps  apr rsa rsp ras rah rap rps pha pas pah par

> Note: I did not have a properly working function that only had real words. This version just makes every possible
> combination with the five characters.

 

## Problem 2

Write a JavaScript program that creates an objective quiz for the user and keeps track of their score. Your program should consist of at least three multiple choice questions, two true/false and one fill in the blank. For the fill in the blank, the user should be able to enter their answer in either upper or lower case.
